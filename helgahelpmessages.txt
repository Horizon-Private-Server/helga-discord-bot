!progscan|For NTSC players, we recommend enabling the Progressive Scan setting each time you start up the game.
!component|If you're playing on a PS2, we recommend investing in component (YPbPr) connector cables to replace the default composite connector cables that came with your PS2. These will provide a slightly clearer picture, and may also help with in-game lag. If your TV/monitor does not have component ports, you'll also need a component to HDMI converter. All of these items are available at various online retailers. Feel free to ask for specific recommendations in the #tech-support channel here.
!lockstrafe|You should always use lock-strafe camera mode for online play on both UYA and DL. Changing this simple setting in your profile will make you 10x better at the game without having to put any effort in.

!cycle|In short, cycling consists of firing three specific weapons and being able to rapidly switch between them. For UYA, the three weapons are the Flux Rifle, Gravity Bomb, and Blitz Gun. For DL, the three weapons are the Fusion Rifle, B6-Obliterator, and Magma Cannon. In competitive lobbies, it is common for these three weapons to be the only ones enabled.
!ig|Heads up! On UYA/Ratchet and Clank 3, if you see "[IG]" at the front of a game lobby name, do not try to join the lobby! "IG" is short for "in-game", meaning that the lobby has already started. UYA does not support joining games that have already started, and if you try to join your PS2 may freeze and/or you may see a network error pop up. If this happens, you will need to reconnect to the server.
!uyabot|On UYA, bots are AI "players" that make great opponents for practice or when no other human players are online. For more info, check out: https://github.com/Horizon-Private-Server/horizon-wiki/blob/main/up-your-arsenal/bots.md
