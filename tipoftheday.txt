Did you know that we have custom maps available for Deadlocked players on PS2 and PCSX2?
Do you know how many of them there are? If you do, please let us know because we have lost count!
For more information, please visit: https://github.com/Horizon-Private-Server/horizon-wiki/blob/main/deadlocked/CMAPS.md;

Did you ever dream of making your own custom maps for Ratchet: Deadlocked?
Thanks to our staff members Dnawrkshp and Badger41, that dream can become a reality thanks to Forge, our custom map editing software.
To get started with Forge, check out: https://github.com/Horizon-Private-Server/horizon-forge/wiki/Setup-Guide;

Hosting a Deadlocked lobby and can't decide who should be on what team?
Try entering '!tm' into the chat to randomly assign half of the players to the blue team and the other half on red team.
Check out the GitHub documentation for optional arguments that can make this tool even more useful! https://github.com/Horizon-Private-Server/horizon-wiki/blob/main/deadlocked/CHATCOMMANDS.MD#teams;

Have you ever been sitting in a Deadlocked lobby and thought "What I really need right now is a random number generator"?
If so, you're in luck! Try entering '!roll' into the chat and the server will respond with a random number between 1 and 100 (inclusive).;

Listen up, you lardballs! The Helga Discord bot is your resource for all Deadlocked stats, not to mention a lot of other cool stuff.

Have you ever gotten sick while playing Deadlocked? We of course mean the Infected custom game mode! In this mode, players become "infected" after dying and must hunt the remaining survivors using only their wrench and their speed. Survivors have the luxury of weapons, but have a limited health and ammo pool - and only one life!
For more information on Infected: https://github.com/Horizon-Private-Server/horizon-wiki/blob/main/deadlocked/GAME_MODES.MD#infected;

Ever played Gun Game on Call of Duty? Now you can play it on Deadlocked too! The rules are similar - you must get one kill with each weapon to advance to the next weapon. For an added challenge, at the end of the game you must kill another player with your wrench! Be careful - if someone else kills you with the wrench, you get demoted!
For more information on Gun Game: https://github.com/Horizon-Private-Server/horizon-wiki/blob/main/deadlocked/GAME_MODES.MD#gun-game;

Do you tend to aim low and hit the ground beneath your opponents? Spleef may be the custom Deadlocked game mode for you!
In this mode, the goal is not to kill your opponent but rather to destroy the ground below his or her feet.
Don't worry - you have multiple opportunities per game to try to send your opponent through the floor.
For more information on Spleef: https://github.com/Horizon-Private-Server/horizon-wiki/blob/main/deadlocked/GAME_MODES.MD#spleef;

Ever imagine that the Deadlocked map is flooding, and you have to keep climbing to get out?
Well, with our custom Infinite Climber game mode you don't have to imagine anymore!
You can even parkour alongside other players. Your score is calculated based on how high you climb.
For more information on Infinite Climber: https://github.com/Horizon-Private-Server/horizon-wiki/blob/main/deadlocked/GAME_MODES.MD#infinite-climber;

Do you know about the Search and Destroy (SND) custom game mode for Deadlocked?
In this mode, you will have to either attack bomb sites or defend them. Be careful - you only get one life!
For more information on SND: https://github.com/Horizon-Private-Server/horizon-wiki/blob/main/deadlocked/GAME_MODES.MD#search-and-destroy-snd;

Brainsssssss! The zombies are coming after you in the Survival custom game mode for Deadlocked.
The difficulty increases with each wave of zombies. Take them on alone, or with your friends!
Survival is supported on multiple custom maps.
For more information on Survival: https://github.com/Horizon-Private-Server/horizon-wiki/blob/main/deadlocked/GAME_MODES.MD#survival;

Hey Deadlocked players! It's time for target practice! The Training custom game mode is designed to help you practice your Fusion rifle aiming against simple multiplayer bots. See how many points you can score!
For more information on the custom Training mode: https://github.com/Horizon-Private-Server/horizon-wiki/blob/main/deadlocked/GAME_MODES.MD#training;

You'll definitely need to know this one for your next trivia night! Ratchet: Deadlocked was first released in North America on October 25, 2005. This would be followed less than a month later by Ratchet: Gladiator in Europe (18 November).;

What is cycling, besides the thing that all the pro players say you don't know how to do?
In short, cycling consists of firing three specific weapons and being able to rapidly switch between them.
For UYA, the three weapons are the Flux Rifle, Gravity Bomb, and Blitz Gun. For DL, the three weapons are the Fusion Rifle, B6-Obliterator, and Magma Cannon.
In competitive lobbies, it is common for these three weapons to be the only ones enabled.;

What's the difference between "Casual" and "Competitive" gameplay on Up Your Arsenal or Deadlocked?
Here's the short version: If you're reading this and you don't already know the answer, assume that the "Casual" games are for you! But for more context, read on.
"Competitive" lobbies are extremely fast-paced and made up of players who have hundreds of games (and in many cases over ten years) worth of experience playing the game at a high level.
If you're a new player, these lobbies will likely not be fun for you. Many competitive players will kick new players from their lobbies because of this.
How can you tell which lobbies are competitive? Look at the number of weapons that are enabled. If there are only 1-3 weapons enabled, then it's likely a competitive lobby.
"Casual" lobbies are basically everything else. These lobbies are much more likely to welcome (and be fun for) new players, and more likely to use 4 or more weapons.;

Lock-strafe mode! You should always use lock-strafe mode for online play. Just do it.;

"How many people are online right now?" This is a question that you will never have to ask when playing either UYA or DL on the Horizon servers.
You can check the #uya-players-online and #dl-players-online channels in this Discord server to see who is on both games in real time.;

Ever feel like an imposter in your own skin? Maybe you just need to change into one of the UYA or DL secret skins!
There are two secret skins for UYA, and five for DL. You can learn how to unlock them at: https://github.com/Horizon-Private-Server/horizon-wiki/blob/main/up-your-arsenal/skins.md;

If you're playing on a PS2, we recommend investing in component (YPbPr) connector cables to replace the default composite connector cables that came with your PS2. These will provide a slightly clearer picture, and may also help with in-game lag. If your TV/monitor does not have component ports, you'll also need a component to HDMI converter. All of these items are available at various online retailers. Feel free to ask for specific recommendations in the #tech-support channel here.;

For both UYA and DL, we recommend enabling the "Progressive Scan" setting. This setting is located in the menu of both games, and unfortunately you will have to set it each time you start the game. The good news is that for NTSC-U/C DL players, the option is also built into the custom mod menu online! NOTE: This option does not apply for PAL players.;

You can choose to play single player music in-game on either UYA or DL from the mod menu settings!
If selected, this option will select tracks randomly from the current game's entire OST, instead of just the ones originally used in multiplayer.
Can't get on today? Throw it back and check out the entire DL soundtrack here: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLwxLlSv5mvIaQ_kytE9-OugbhEEyAIImG;

Looking for someone to play with? Try tagging one of our opt-in roles!
All opt-in roles are described in the #roles channel of our Discord server. React to the message there to add yourself to whichever roles you like.
If you change your mind, simply un-react to the same message to remove the corresponding role.
To use the role, tag it in an appropriate channel. Others with the role will be pinged and know that you want to play!
One final note - the "Competitive" roles unlock a competitive-only Discord chat channel for each game.;

Horizon is fortunate to have several community members who host regular events on both games. Check the Events list at the top of this Discord server regularly to view all upcoming events. Don't forget to click the "Interested" button on relevant events so that you will receive a reminder when the event starts!;

Both UYA/Ratchet and Clank 3 and DL/Gladiator have a "Save Password" option on the profile creation page. We recommend enabling this option for both games, because:
- It will prevent you from needing to enter a password each time you log in.
- It will help prevent other people from accessing your account.
- It allows you to "transfer" your account between different devices, e.g. from PCSX2 to PS2 and back.
Choose a strong password and write it down somewhere safe, like you would any other password. If you forget your password, please let us know in the #tech-support channel here on Discord and a staff member should be able to help you reset it.;

Beep boop! Thanks to Fourbolt, the Horizon server for UYA/Ratchet and Clank 3 features bots!
Bots are AI "players" that make great opponents for practice, or when no other human players are online.
For more information on bots, check out: https://github.com/Horizon-Private-Server/horizon-wiki/blob/main/up-your-arsenal/bots.md;

We have dozens of custom maps available for NTSC-U/C and PAL players on UYA/Ratchet and Clank 3! These work on both PS2 and PCSX2.
For more information, please visit: https://github.com/Horizon-Private-Server/horizon-wiki/blob/main/up-your-arsenal/CMAPS.md;

No V2s? V2s all the time? V2s that are eliminated with you? No health boxes?
All of these are now available in UYA/Ratchet and Clank 3 as configurable mod menu settings, thanks to Agent Moose.
For the most up-to-date list of available settings, LOG IN AND SEE FOR YOURSELF!
More information on UYA mods is at: https://github.com/Horizon-Private-Server/horizon-wiki/blob/main/up-your-arsenal/CMODS.md;

Heads up! On UYA/Ratchet and Clank 3, if you see "[IG]" at the front of a game lobby name, do not try to join the lobby! "IG" is short for "in-game", meaning that the lobby has already started. UYA does not support joining games that have already started, and if you try to join your PS2 may freeze and/or you may see a network error pop up. If this happens, you will need to reconnect to the server.;

Are you getting error messages when trying to join lobbies on UYA/Ratchet and Clank 3? Check if the name of the lobby has "[IG]" at the front of it. This text (short for "in-game") means that the game has already started, and that you will not be able to join. Keep an eye out for when the game ends so that you can join the next one!;

Did you ever dream of making your own custom maps for Ratchet & Clank: Up Your Arsenal?
With our custom Forge software, you can create your own custom maps for both NTSC and PAL players.
To get started with Forge, check out: https://github.com/Horizon-Private-Server/horizon-forge/wiki/Setup-Guide;

How the heck do they move and shoot like that? If you have ever wondered this while playing UYA, you might want to check out our UYA Competitive Training YouTube playlist!

Can't get on today? Relive some Ratchet & Clank nostalgia on the go with Horizon staff member DeathBySnowman's curated playlist of his 15 favorite tracks from UYA/R&C 3's single player mode.

Fun fact! Ratchet & Clank: Up Your Arsenal was first released in North America on November 2, 2004. This was followed soon after by the European release on 12 November.;

Ever wonder why we chose the name "Horizon"? We wanted to get away from the Ratchet and Clank Online branding, and avoid any potential confusion around the R & C name in general. For example if we named the server "Ratchet and Clank: Horizon" some might have thought it was an upcoming game from Insomniac.;

Why bother boosting the Horizon Discord server? Boosting unlocks Discord features in the server such as better streaming and audio quality. Your support means a lot to us!;

Did you know that running the Horizon game servers for UYA and DL costs money?
If you want to help chip in, please consider subscribing to our Discord server. All funds go directly towards hosting our private servers. Any additional funds will either be saved for future hosting costs, or used for community-focused content like tournaments/special produced videos/etc.
You can find more info about subscriptions by clicking "Server Subscriptions" at the top of the Discord server. If you have additional questions, please contact a staff member.;

Short on cash but want to help out the Horizon community? There are other ways to lend a hand! Some possible examples of this are:
- Hosting regular events on UYA and/or DL to get people online.
- Answering questions from other community members in the #tech-support Discord channel.
- Recording gameplay footage and sending it to us to post to the Horizon YouTube channel.
- Trying out new features to help us beta test.
- Spreading the word about Horizon to your friends and in other online communities that you're a part of!
Staff members will award VIP status (Horizon VIP role) to those who consistently help out. Thank you for your support!;

Did you know? Horizon offers both NTSC-U/C and PAL version support for both Ratchet and Clank: Up Your Arsenal (Ratchet and Clank 3) and Ratchet: Deadlocked (Ratchet: Gladiator). There is crossplay between the two versions, meaning that NTSC-U/C players can play in the same game lobby as PAL players. You can connect to our servers from any PS2 with a network adapter, the PCSX2 emulator for PC, or our DreadZone Online client (Deadlocked only).
Full setup details can be found at: https://github.com/Horizon-Private-Server/horizon-wiki/blob/main/getting-online/README.md;

You can host your own event and have it listed in the Horizon Events list! The only requirement is that you must commit to being online and available for at least one hour, starting at the day and time you pick.
Please contact a Horizon staff member to set up your event in the list. We will ask you about the other event details such as:
- Which game (UYA or DL) will you be playing?
- What kinds of lobbies will you be playing? (competitive, casual, meme lobbies with mines only, etc.)
- Any other details that potential attendees should know?;

Your own gameplay recordings of UYA or DL can be shared on the Horizon YouTube channel!
We would love to feature your gameplay! The only requirements for this are:
- Capture card quality footage only please. We like throwing it back, but not THAT much.
- We don't want to get flagged for copyright violations, so please use only the game audio (with or without commentary).
- Please choose matches that were competitive. Your 20-0 1v1 victory over someone just figuring out how to play bores most viewers, and frankly us too.
Please send your footage to DeathBySnowman, or use our Google Form: https://forms.gle/77yX7nNpqe5vEiz48;

Fan of UYA but never tried DL? Or vice versa? We recommend that you broaden your Horizon(s)!
(we're really sorry for that pun, though);

Do most Horizon staff members like DL more, or UYA? Well, the truth is HEY DON'T TELL THEM THAT!! IT'S A SECRET!;

Why did so many Horizon staff members choose screen names that are animals? It's one of nature's mysteries!;

Ever wonder what DeathBySnowman does when he isn't playing UYA? Well, he has to spend a lot of time in the walk-in freezer during the warmer months. But the rest of the time, he is likely playing disc golf. Since 2020 he has played over 300 different disc golf courses across 20 different US states (from Alaska to Florida) and Iceland.;

For today's "tip", we just want to thank you for being a part of the Horizon community! We value all of our community members and strive to provide the best online experience possible. If you ever have any feedback or ideas for us, don't hesitate to post them in the #suggestions channel of this Discord server!;

Did you know? The Horizon servers became available to the public on February 9, 2022.;
