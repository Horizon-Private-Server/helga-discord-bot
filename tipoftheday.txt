Did you know that we have custom maps available for Deadlocked players on PS2 and PCSX2?
Do you know how many of them there are? If you do, please let us know because we have lost count!
DL custom maps (along with the many custom game modes) are possible thanks to the tireless work of Badger41, Dnawrkshp, and Agent Moose.
For more information, please visit: https://github.com/Horizon-Private-Server/horizon-wiki/blob/main/deadlocked/CMAPS.md;

Hosting a Deadlocked lobby and can't decide who should be on what team?
Try entering '!tm' into the chat to randomly assign half of the players to the blue team and the other half on red team.
Check out the GitHub documentation for optional arguments that can make this tool even more useful! https://github.com/Horizon-Private-Server/horizon-wiki/blob/main/deadlocked/CHATCOMMANDS.MD#teams;

Have you ever been sitting in a Deadlocked lobby and thought "What I really need right now is a random number generator"?
If so, you're in luck! Try entering '!roll' into the chat and the server will respond with a random number between 1 and 100 (inclusive).;

Listen up, you lardballs! The Helga Discord bot is your resource for all Deadlocked stats.
For a complete list of commands and instructions, visit: https://github.com/Horizon-Private-Server/horizon-wiki/blob/main/deadlocked/HELGA.MD#dl;

Have you ever gotten sick while playing Deadlocked? We of course mean the Infected custom game mode! In this mode, players become "infected" after dying and must hunt the remaining survivors using only their wrench and their speed. Survivors have the luxury of weapons, but have a limited health and ammo pool - and only one life!
For more information on Infected: https://github.com/Horizon-Private-Server/horizon-wiki/blob/main/deadlocked/GAME_MODES.MD#infected;

Ever played Gun Game on Call of Duty? Now you can play it on Deadlocked too! The rules are similar - you must get one kill with each weapon to advance to the next weapon. For an added challenge, at the end of the game you must kill another player with your wrench! Be careful - if someone else kills you with the wrench, you get demoted!
For more information on Gun Game: https://github.com/Horizon-Private-Server/horizon-wiki/blob/main/deadlocked/GAME_MODES.MD#gun-game;

Do you tend to aim low and hit the ground beneath your opponents? Spleef may be the custom Deadlocked game mode for you!
In this mode, the goal is not to kill your opponent but rather to destroy the ground below his or her feet.
Don't worry - you have multiple opportunities per game to try to send your opponent through the floor.
For more information on Spleef: https://github.com/Horizon-Private-Server/horizon-wiki/blob/main/deadlocked/GAME_MODES.MD#spleef;

Ever imagine that the Deadlocked map is flooding, and you have to keep climbing to get out?
Well, with our custom Infinite Climber game mode you don't have to imagine anymore!
You can even parkour alongside other players. Your score is calculated based on how high you climb.
For more information on Infinite Climber: https://github.com/Horizon-Private-Server/horizon-wiki/blob/main/deadlocked/GAME_MODES.MD#infinite-climber;

Do you know about the Search and Destroy (SND) custom game mode for Deadlocked?
In this mode, you will have to either attack bomb sites or defend them. Be careful - you only get one life!
For more information on SND: https://github.com/Horizon-Private-Server/horizon-wiki/blob/main/deadlocked/GAME_MODES.MD#search-and-destroy-snd;

Brainsssssss! The zombies are coming after you in the Survival custom game mode for Deadlocked.
The difficulty increases with each wave of zombies. Take them on alone, or with your friends!
For more information on Survival: https://github.com/Horizon-Private-Server/horizon-wiki/blob/main/deadlocked/GAME_MODES.MD#survival;

Hey Deadlocked players! It's time for target practice! The Training custom game mode is designed to help you practice your Fusion rifle aiming against simple multiplayer bots. See how many points you can score!
For more information on the custom Training mode: https://github.com/Horizon-Private-Server/horizon-wiki/blob/main/deadlocked/GAME_MODES.MD#training;

What is cycling, besides the thing that all the pro players say you don't know how to do?
In short, cycling consists of firing three specific weapons and being able to rapidly switch between them.
For UYA, the three weapons are the Flux Rifle, Gravity Bomb, and Blitz Gun. For DL, the three weapons are the Fusion Rifle, B6-Obliterator, and Magma Cannon.
In competitive lobbies, it is common for these three weapons to be the only ones enabled.;

Lock-strafe mode! You should always use lock-strafe mode for online play. Just do it.;

"How many people are online right now?" This is a question that you will never have to ask when playing either UYA or DL on the Horizon servers.
You can check the #uya-players-online and #dl-players-online channels in this Discord server to see who is on both games in real time.;

Ever feel like an imposter in your own skin? Maybe you just need to change into one of the UYA or DL secret skins!
There are two secret skins for UYA, and five for DL. You can learn how to unlock them at: https://github.com/Horizon-Private-Server/horizon-wiki/blob/main/up-your-arsenal/skins.md;

If you're playing on a PS2, we recommend investing in component (YPbPr) connector cables to replace the default composite connector cables that came with your PS2. These will provide a slightly clearer picture, and may also help with in-game lag. If your TV/monitor does not have component ports, you'll also need a component to HDMI converter. All of these items are available at various online retailers. Feel free to ask for specific recommendations in the #tech-support channel here.;

For both UYA and DL, we recommend enabling the "Progressive Scan" setting. This setting is located in the main (not online) menu of both games, and unfortunately you will have to set it each time you start the game. The good news for those playing on the Deadlocked server (only) is that the option is also built into the custom mod menu! NOTE: This option only applies for NTSC-U/C players.;

Looking for someone to play with? Try tagging one of our opt-in roles!
All opt-in roles are described in the #roles channel of our Discord server. React to the message there to add yourself to whichever roles you like.
If you change your mind, simply un-react to the same message to remove the corresponding role.
To use the role, tag it in an appropriate channel. Others with the role will be pinged and know that you want to play!;

Horizon is fortunate to have several community members who host regular events on both games. Check the Events list at the top of this Discord server regularly to view all upcoming events. Don't forget to click the "Interested" button on relevant events so that you will receive a reminder when the event starts!;

Both UYA/Ratchet and Clank 3 and DL/Gladiator have a "Save Password" option on the profile creation page. We recommend enabling this option for both games, because:
- It will prevent you from needing to enter a password each time you log in.
- It will help prevent other people from accessing your account.
- It allows you to "transfer" your account between different devices, e.g. from PCSX2 to PS2 and back.
Write down your password somewhere safe, like you would any other password. If you forget your password, please let us know in the #tech-support channel here on Discord and a staff member should be able to help you reset it.;

Beep boop! Thanks to Fourbolt, the Horizon server for UYA/Ratchet and Clank 3 features bots!
Bots are AI "players" that make great opponents for practice, or when no other human players are online.
For more information on bots, check out: https://github.com/Horizon-Private-Server/horizon-wiki/blob/main/up-your-arsenal/bots.md;

You may know about bots on UYA/Ratchet and Clank 3 - but do you know about the CPUG challenge?
If you can record yourself defeating a G-level bot using certain lobby settings, we will award you the Godlike role.
This is even better than the ice bucket challenge!
For complete rules, check out: https://github.com/Horizon-Private-Server/horizon-wiki/blob/main/up-your-arsenal/bots.md#cpug-challenge;

Did you know that you can follow UYA/Ratchet and Clank 3 games live without being in them?
Or view detailed match statistics after the game, alongside a map that shows exactly where you got kevorked by that Trooper's midair fantasy shot?
Nick#1's UYATracker website is home to all of this and more!
See how you stack up to the competition at: https://www.uyatracker.net/;

Have you ever played a beta version of a game online? How about a beta version of an 18 year old game?
Using our test server, you can play several beta versions of UYA online.
For more information, check out: https://github.com/Horizon-Private-Server/horizon-wiki/blob/main/up-your-arsenal/betas.md;

Hacker alert! Did you know that you can customize colors in your UYA/Ratchet and Clank 3 clan tags? Big Al would be proud.
For full instructions, check out: https://github.com/Horizon-Private-Server/horizon-wiki/blob/main/up-your-arsenal/clantags.md;

Heads up! On UYA/Ratchet and Clank 3, if you see "[IG]" at the front of a game lobby name, do not try to join the lobby! "IG" is short for "in-game", meaning that the lobby has already started. UYA does not support joining games that have already started, and if you try to join your PS2 may freeze and/or you may see a network error pop up. If this happens, you will need to reconnect to the server.;

Are you getting error messages when trying to join lobbies on UYA/Ratchet and Clank 3? Check if the name of the lobby has "[IG]" at the front of it. This text (short for "in-game") means that the game has already started, and that you will not be able to join. Keep an eye out for when the game ends so that you can join the next one!;

Tagg - you're it! On UYA/Ratchet and Clank 3, you can manually adjust the amount of time the server aggregates packets before sending the data to other players. English please? This means that you can tweak the apparent amount of lag for the next game that you create.
For more details, check out: https://github.com/Horizon-Private-Server/horizon-wiki/blob/main/up-your-arsenal/cities.md#lag-adjustment;

How the heck do they move and shoot like that? If you have ever wondered this while playing UYA, you might want to check out our UYA Competitive Gameplay YouTube playlist! Thanks to Cy/iStronkz for contributing videos to this list.
https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLUCKuUL8PUCEyvlWo-fZxj7Om_r2UEpB5;

Ever wonder why we chose the name "Horizon"? We wanted to get away from the Ratchet and Clank Online branding, and avoid any potential confusion around the R & C name in general. For example if we named the server "Ratchet and Clank: Horizon" some might have thought it was an upcoming game from Insomniac.;

Why bother boosting the Horizon Discord server? Boosting unlocks Discord features in the server such as better streaming and audio quality, more custom emojis, and other fun perks.;

Did you know that running the Horizon game servers for UYA and DL costs money?
If you want to help chip in, please consider subscribing to our Discord server. All funds go directly towards hosting our private servers. Any additional funds will be saved for either future hosting costs or for community tournaments.
You can find more info about subscriptions by clicking "Server Subscriptions" at the top of the Discord server. If you have additional questions, please contact a staff member.;

Short on cash but want to help out the Horizon community? There are other ways to help us out as well! Some possible examples of this are:
- Hosting regular events on UYA and/or DL to get people online.
- Answering questions from other community members in the #tech-support Discord channel.
- Recording gameplay footage and sending it to us to post to the Horizon YouTube channel.
Staff members will award VIP status (Horizon VIP role) to those who consistently help out. Thank you for your support!;

Did you know? Horizon offers both NTSC-U/C and PAL version support for both Ratchet and Clank: Up Your Arsenal (Ratchet and Clank 3) and Ratchet: Deadlocked (Ratchet: Gladiator). There is crossplay between the two versions, meaning that NTSC-U/C players can play in the same game lobby as PAL players. You can connect to our servers from any PS2 with a network adapter, or the PCSX2 emulator for PC.
Full setup details can be found at: https://github.com/Horizon-Private-Server/horizon-wiki/blob/main/getting-online/README.md;

You can host your own event and have it listed in the Horizon Events list! The only requirement is that you must commit to being online and available for at least one hour, starting at the day and time you pick.
Please contact DeathBySnowman to set up your event in the list. He will ask you about the other event details such as:
- Which game (UYA or DL) will you be playing?
- What kinds of lobbies will you be playing? (competitive, casual, meme lobbies with mines only, etc.)
- Any other details that potential attendees should know?;

Your own gameplay recordings of UYA or DL can be shared on the Horizon YouTube channel!
We would love to feature your gameplay! The only requirements for this are:
- Capture card quality footage only please. We like throwing it back, but not THAT much.
- We don't want to get flagged for copyright violations, so please use only the game audio (with or without commentary).
- Please choose matches that were competitive. Your 20-0 1v1 victory over someone just figuring out how to play bores most viewers, and frankly us too.
Please send your footage to DeathBySnowman. Google Drive links (or similar) work best.;

Fan of UYA but never tried DL? Or vice versa? We recommend that you broaden your Horizon(s)!
(we're really sorry for that pun, though);

Why did so many Horizon staff members choose screen names that are animals? It's one of nature's mysteries!;

Ever wonder what DeathBySnowman does when he isn't playing UYA? Well, he has to spend a lot of time in the walk-in freezer during the warmer months. But the rest of the time, he is likely playing disc golf. Since 2020 he has played over 180 different disc golf courses across 13 different US states, from Alaska to Florida.;

For today's "tip", we just want to thank you for being a part of the Horizon community! We value all of our community members and strive to provide the best online experience possible. If you ever have any feedback or ideas for us, don't hesitate to post them in the #suggestions channel of this Discord server!;

Did you know? The Horizon servers became available to the public on February 9, 2022.;
